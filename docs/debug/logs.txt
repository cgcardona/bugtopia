After rebuilding the app I am still gettnig the same incorrect behavior. 

1. The app loads quickly however despite the GUI saying there is 3000+ food the only food which I see is the handful visually in the front.
2. The bugs don't seem drawn to the food.
3. The food doesn't disappear when the bug moves over the food.
4. I'm unable to click on the bug to see it's stats.
5. I still see many of the following errors: "Modifying state during view update, this will cause undefined behavior." How can we stack trace those errors so we can figure out exaclty what's happening and where the code is getting called from?

LOGS:

The app builds but I'm seeing several issues

1. "Food:" coount is increasing/decreasing/increasing which implies that food is getting added to our world and consumed but I'm not visually seeing it. Please confirm that the correct type of food, per biom and terrain type/layer. Please  ELI5 how food gets added to a place on the terrain
2. Bugtopia should have 4 terrain layers based on Z indexâ€”underground, surface, canopy and ariel. There should be ramps betweem layers so that the bugs can explore different layers.
3. I'm unable to click and select a bug to see it's stats.
4. When I click the "Next Gen" button some of the bugs disappear and some appear to evolve in place meaning they change colors and get slightly larger/smaller.
5. The logs are full of "Modifying state during view update, this will cause undefined behavior." How can we add a stack trace to figure out exactly where and when that failing state update is happening?
