## 🌎 **WORLD TYPES: The Foundation**

World Types are the **primary architectural constraint** that shapes everything else. Each world type has:

### 🏔️ **Height Generation Patterns**

| World Type | Height Range | Elevation Pattern | Visual Theme |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **🌊 Abyss** | -55m to -25m | Deep underwater trenches | Dark depths, oceanic, mysterious |
| **🏝️ Archipelago** | -10m to +5m | Island chains with water | Tropical, scattered, water-rich |
| **🏜️ Canyon** | -25m to +25m | Deep valleys and high mesas | Desert canyons, dramatic elevation |
| **🕳️ Cavern** | -38m to -22m | Underground cave systems | Subterranean, rocky, enclosed |
| **🌍 Continental** | -25m to +40m | Varied terrain with all features | Diverse, all biomes possible |
| **☁️ Skylands** | +5m to +45m | Floating islands, elevated | Aerial, windswept, high-altitude |
| **🌋 Volcano** | -5m to +40m | Volcanic peaks and lava flows | Dangerous, rocky, hot |

### 🌿 **Biome Constraints**

Each world type **dramatically restricts** which biomes can appear:

| World Type | Allowed Biomes | Reasoning |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **🌊 Abyss** | Tundra, Alpine, Wetlands | Cold depths, harsh underwater conditions |
| **🏝️ Archipelago** | Coastal, Tropical Rainforest, Wetlands, Temperate Forest | Water-rich, tropical island environments |
| **🏜️ Canyon** | Desert, Temperate Grassland, Alpine, Savanna | Arid, rocky, sparse vegetation |
| **🕳️ Cavern** | Tundra, Alpine | Underground, cold, minimal vegetation |
| **🌍 Continental** | **ALL 10 BIOMES** | Standard continental diversity |
| **☁️ Skylands** | Temperate Forest, Alpine, Temperate Grassland, Boreal Forest | High-altitude, temperate conditions |
| **🌋 Volcano** | Desert, Alpine, Savanna | Hot, rocky, dangerous volcanic conditions |

---

## 🏔️ **TERRAIN LAYERS: Vertical World Structure**

The 4-layer system creates distinct **vertical ecological zones** with different accessibility requirements:

### 📏 **Layer Specifications**

| Layer | Height Range | Center Z | Accessibility | Primary Features |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **☁️ Aerial** | 30m to 200m | 60m | Flight required | Open sky, wind currents, maximum freedom |
| **🌳 Canopy** | 10m to 30m | 20m | Climbing or flight | Tree tops, elevated platforms, organic highways |
| **🌍 Surface** | -30m to 10m | -10m | Universal access | Ground level, hills, water, primary terrain |
| **🕳️ Underground** | -50m to -30m | -40m | Swimming or climbing | Caves, tunnels, underground rivers |

### 🚪 **Layer Access Requirements**

Different bug species need specific 3D movement capabilities to access layers:

```swift
// Bug capability requirements per layer
case .aerial: canFly required (wingSpan > 0.5)
case .canopy: canClimb || canFly (climbingGrip > 0.4 || wingSpan > 0.5)  
case .surface: universal access (all bugs)
case .underground: canSwim || canClimb (divingDepth > 0.3 || climbingGrip > 0.4)
```

## 🌿 **BIOME TYPES: Climate-Based Ecosystems**

The 10 biome types are determined by **temperature + moisture**, but **constrained by world type**:

### 🌡️ **Climate-Based Generation**

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Vegetation Density | Primary Terrain |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **⛰️ Alpine** | Cold | Various | 0.2 (20%) | Hill/Ice |
| **🌲 Boreal Forest** | < -0.3 | ≥ 0.3 | 0.7 (70%) | Forest |
| **🏖️ Coastal** | Moderate | High | 0.5 (50%) | Water/Sand |
| **🏜️ Desert** | ≥ 0.3 | < 0.3 | 0.05 (5%) | Sand |
| **🌿 Savanna** | ≥ 0.3 | 0.3-0.7 | 0.3 (30%) | Open |
| **🌾 Temperate Grassland** | -0.3 to 0.3 | < 0.3 | 0.4 (40%) | Open |
| **🌲 Temperate Forest** | -0.3 to 0.3 | ≥ 0.3 | 0.9 (90%) | Forest |
| **🌴 Tropical Rainforest** | > 0.3 | ≥ 0.7 | 1.0 (100%) | Forest |
| **❄️ Tundra** | < -0.3 | < 0.3 | 0.1 (10%) | Ice |
| **💧 Wetlands** | Various | High | 0.8 (80%) | Water/Swamp |

### 🎯 **World Type Filtering**

The system first calculates what biome the climate suggests, then checks if that biome is **allowed** for the current world type. If not, it finds the **closest allowed biome**.

Canopy: Forest-heavy, elevated platforms, tree highways
Aerial: Wind currents, open sky, minimal solid terrain
```

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

Bugtopia's world building system creates **emergent complexity** through hierarchical constraints:

1. **World Types** establish the fundamental environmental framework
2. **Terrain Layers** provide 3D structure and accessibility challenges  
3. **Biomes** create climate-based ecological niches (filtered by world type)
4. **Terrain Types** add specific movement and survival challenges
5. **Bug Species** evolve specialized adaptations for their environment
6. **Social Systems** emerge from environmental pressures and opportunities
7. **Tools** allow environmental modification and adaptation
8. **Dynamic Systems** (weather/seasons/disasters) create ongoing pressure

This creates **7 distinct world experiences** where the same underlying systems produce dramatically different evolutionary outcomes, from deep-sea diving specialists in Abyss worlds to aerial acrobats in Skylands environments.

Each world type feels **genuinely unique** while using the same underlying biological and social systems, creating high replayability and diverse evolutionary trajectories.
