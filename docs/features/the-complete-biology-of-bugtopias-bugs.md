## üöÄ **Scavenger Species - Future Expansion Ideas**

### **üî¨ Planned Scavenger Specializations**

#### **1. Carrion Feeders**
- **Special Ability**: Consume dead bugs for high energy (80+ energy)
- **Behavior**: Attracted to bug death sites, clean up ecosystem
- **Evolution**: Enhanced detection of death pheromones, disease resistance
- **Ecological Role**: Prevent disease spread, energy recycling

#### **2. Waste Processors** 
- **Special Ability**: Convert expired/rotten food into usable energy
- **Behavior**: Seek out old food items other species avoid
- **Evolution**: Stronger digestive systems, toxin resistance
- **Ecological Role**: Clean up environment, extend food chain

#### **3. Tool Scavengers**
- **Special Ability**: Salvage and repurpose abandoned bug tools/constructions
- **Behavior**: Follow other species, collect their dropped items
- **Evolution**: Enhanced memory, tool manipulation abilities
- **Ecological Role**: Technology recycling, innovation spread

#### **4. Social Parasites**
- **Special Ability**: Steal food from other bugs' food caches/signals
- **Behavior**: Infiltrate groups, exploit social systems
- **Evolution**: Mimicry abilities, social manipulation skills
- **Ecological Role**: Evolutionary pressure for better group security

## üß¨ **How Bugs Should Evolve Over Generations**

### **üéØ Trait Evolution Pressures**

#### **Physical Traits**
- **Size**: Larger bugs = more energy storage but higher consumption
- **Speed**: Faster bugs = better food access but higher energy cost
- **Vision Radius**: Better food detection vs. neural processing energy cost
- **Energy Efficiency**: Core survival trait - always under selection pressure

#### **Neural Network Evolution**
- **Food-Finding Networks**: Strengthen pathways that lead to successful feeding
- **Predator Avoidance**: Enhance threat detection and escape responses  
- **Social Cooperation**: Develop group coordination for food sharing/protection
- **Memory Patterns**: Improve spatial memory for food source locations

#### **Behavioral Evolution**
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance between searching vs consuming
- **Risk Assessment**: Learn optimal trade-offs between safety and opportunity
- **Social Strategies**: Evolve cooperation, competition, or dominance patterns
- **Circadian Rhythms**: Develop optimal feeding/movement timing

### **üåç Environmental Pressures**

#### **Seasonal Adaptations**
- **Winter Preparations**: Enhanced energy storage, slower metabolism
- **Spring Growth**: Increased reproduction drive, territory establishment
- **Summer Activity**: Peak foraging, maximum social interaction
- **Fall Harvesting**: Food gathering, preparation behaviors

#### **Terrain Specializations**
- **Mountain Climbers**: Enhanced grip, altitude tolerance
- **Water Navigators**: Swimming adaptations, aquatic food access
- **Desert Survivors**: Water conservation, heat resistance
- **Forest Dwellers**: Camouflage, tree navigation skills

## üé® **Visual DNA Expression System**

### **üß¨ Genetic-to-Visual Mapping**

#### **Size Variations** 
- **Range**: 0.5x to 2.0x base size
- **Genetics**: `dna.size` directly controls visual scaling
- **Effects**: Larger bugs more visible, smaller bugs harder to click
- **Evolution**: Balances visibility vs. stealth survival strategies

#### **Color Genetics**
- **Species Base**: Each species has base color palette
- **DNA Modulation**: `dna.aggression`, `dna.camouflage` affect hue/saturation
- **Environmental**: Terrain adaptation influences color shifts
- **Social**: Group membership affects color patterns

#### **Wing Pattern Generation**
- **Algorithm**: Procedural patterns based on genetic algorithms
- **Factors**: `dna.speed`, `dna.energyEfficiency`, `dna.visionRadius`
- **Inheritance**: Parent wing patterns blend in offspring
- **Mutations**: Random pattern variations for genetic diversity

#### **Movement Personality**
- **Aggressive**: Sharp, quick movements with sudden direction changes
- **Cautious**: Smooth, predictable paths with frequent pauses
- **Social**: Tendency to move toward other bugs, group formations
- **Exploratory**: Wide-ranging, curious movement patterns

## üéØ **Expected Evolution Outcomes**

### **üèÜ Successful Evolution Patterns**

#### **Generation 1-5**: Basic Survival
- Bugs learn basic food location and consumption
- High mortality, random neural patterns
- Simple predator-prey relationships emerge

#### **Generation 6-15**: Specialization

## üéÆ **What You Should Observe**

### **üîç Signs of Successful Evolution**
1. **Food Targeting**: Bugs should now visibly move toward food instead of random wandering
2. **Food Consumption**: Food items should disappear when bugs reach them  
3. **Species Behavior**: Different species should exhibit distinct movement patterns
4. **Energy Management**: Hungry bugs more aggressive in food seeking
5. **Population Stability**: Consistent ~20 bugs per generation with natural variations

### **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Testing the Recent Fixes**
- **Watch for hunger-driven food seeking** (exploration threshold now 0.7 vs 0.4)
- **Monitor food disappearance** (improved precision matching)  
- **Enjoy cleaner logs** (removed noisy debug spam)
- **Look for species-specific behaviors** emerging over generations

The bugs should now exhibit much more realistic and engaging behaviors! üêõ‚ú®
