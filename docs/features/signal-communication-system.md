# 🗣️ Signal & Communication System

> **Advanced signal-based communication enabling social intelligence, pack coordination, and emergent cooperation in Bugtopia's evolutionary ecosystem.**

## 🌟 Overview

The Signal & Communication System allows bugs to share information, coordinate behaviors, and form social groups through evolved communication abilities. This creates emergent social intelligence where bugs can hunt in packs, share resources, warn of dangers, and work together for survival.

## 📡 Signal Types

Bugtopia features **9 distinct signal types** that bugs can emit and respond to:

### Core Communication Signals

| Signal Type | Emoji | Priority | Purpose | Context Data |
|------------|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **`foodFound`** | 🍃 | Medium (0.6) | "I found food here!" | Food position |
| **`dangerAlert`** | ⚠️ | Highest (1.0) | "Predator nearby!" | Threat ID |
| **`huntCall`** | 🎯 | High (0.8) | "Join me in hunting!" | Hunt target ID |
| **`mateCall`** | 💕 | Lower (0.4) | "Looking for a mate" | None |
| **`territoryMark`** | 🏴 | Lower (0.4) | "This is my territory" | None |
| **`helpRequest`** | 🆘 | High (0.8) | "I need assistance" | Energy level |
| **`groupForm`** | 🤝 | Medium (0.6) | "Let's form a group" | Group size |
| **`retreat`** | 🏃 | Highest (1.0) | "Everyone scatter!" | None |
| **`foodShare`** | 🍯 | Medium (0.6) | "I'm sharing food!" | Food position + energy |

## 🧬 Communication DNA

Each bug inherits **6 communication traits** that evolve over generations:

### Core Communication Traits

```swift
struct CommunicationDNA {
    let signalStrength: Double      // How far signals can travel (0.0-1.0)
    let signalSensitivity: Double   // Ability to detect incoming signals (0.0-1.0)
    let communicationFrequency: Double // How often to send signals (0.0-1.0)
    let signalTrust: Double         // Trust level for received signals (0.0-1.0)
    let socialResponseRate: Double  // Likelihood to respond to group calls (0.0-1.0)
    let signalMemory: Int          // How long to remember signals (30-300 ticks)
}
```

### Trait Evolution

- **High Signal Strength**: Bugs can communicate over longer distances
- **High Sensitivity**: Better at detecting faint or distant signals
- **High Communication Frequency**: More likely to share information
- **High Signal Trust**: More likely to believe and act on signals
- **High Social Response**: More cooperative and group-oriented
- **Long Signal Memory**: Remember important information longer

## 📊 Signal Mechanics

### Signal Propagation

```swift
struct Signal {
    let type: SignalType           // What kind of signal
    let position: CGPoint         // Where it was emitted
    let emitterId: UUID          // Who sent it
    let strength: Double         // Signal intensity (0.0-1.0)
    let timestamp: TimeInterval  // When it was created
    let data: SignalData?        // Additional context
}
```

### Range & Decay

- **Signal Range**: `strength × 100.0` (max range in world units)
- **Time Decay**: Signals fade over 5 seconds maximum
- **Distance Attenuation**: Signals weaken with distance
- **Minimum Strength**: Signals below 0.1 strength are ignored

### Signal Data Context

```swift
struct SignalData {
    let foodPosition: CGPoint?    // For food_found and food_share
    let threatId: UUID?          // For danger_alert signals
    let huntTargetId: UUID?      // For hunt_call signals
    let energyLevel: Double?     // For help_request and food_share
    let groupSize: Int?          // For group_form signals
}
```

## 🤝 Social Behaviors

### Pack Hunting Coordination

**Hunt Call Mechanics:**
1. **Leader Initiation**: Bug with high hunting desire becomes pack leader
2. **Signal Emission**: Broadcasts `huntCall` with target prey ID
3. **Pack Formation**: Nearby bugs join hunting group automatically
4. **Coordinated Attack**: Pack members gain massive success bonuses:
   - **Solo**: 0% bonus (baseline)
   - **Duo**: +25% success rate
   - **Trio**: +45% success rate  
   - **Squad (4)**: +60% success rate
   - **Large pack**: +75% success rate (maximum)
5. **Energy Sharing**: Successful hunt splits energy among all participants

### Resource Sharing

**Food Share Mechanics:**
1. **Generous Bugs**: High social response rate bugs share food when energy > 50
2. **Energy Split**: 60% kept for self, 40% offered to group
3. **Signal Broadcast**: `foodShare` signal announces available energy
4. **Group Response**: Nearby hungry group members receive energy portions
5. **Social Bonds**: Sharing builds long-term group cohesion

### Group Formation

**Dynamic Group Creation:**
- **Spontaneous Formation**: High social bugs emit `groupForm` signals
- **Proximity Joining**: Nearby compatible bugs join groups
- **Role Assignment**: Automatic role distribution (leader, hunter, member, etc.)
- **Group Dissolution**: Groups dissolve after 10 seconds of inactivity
- **Territory Claiming**: Groups can claim and defend territories

## 🧠 Neural Integration

### Signal Processing in Neural Networks

Communication signals are processed through the bug's neural network with **8 communication-specific inputs**:

1. **Recent Signal Count**: Number of signals received recently
2. **Signal Diversity**: Variety of signal types heard
3. **Group Membership**: Whether bug belongs to a group
4. **Social Energy**: Energy available for social behaviors
5. **Communication Cooldown**: Time until next signal can be sent
6. **Trust Level**: Average trust in recent signals
7. **Leadership Status**: Whether bug is a group leader
8. **Cooperation Opportunity**: Potential for group activities

### Decision-Making Integration

The neural network's **social output** (0.0-1.0) influences:
- **Signal Emission**: Higher social output = more communication
- **Response Rate**: Likelihood to respond to group calls
- **Cooperation**: Willingness to share resources and coordinate
- **Leadership**: Tendency to form and lead groups

## 🎯 Emergent Social Intelligence

### Advanced Behaviors

**Observed Emergent Patterns:**
- **Information Networks**: Bugs share food locations across the population
- **Danger Cascades**: Predator alerts spread rapidly through groups
- **Hunting Coordination**: Carnivore packs develop sophisticated hunting strategies

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### Signal Processing Pipeline

1. **Signal Generation**: Neural network decides when to communicate
2. **Signal Emission**: Bug creates signal with DNA-determined strength
3. **Signal Propagation**: Other bugs within range receive signal
4. **Trust Filtering**: Recipients evaluate signal credibility
5. **Response Decision**: Neural network processes signal and decides response
6. **Behavioral Change**: Bug modifies behavior based on signal content

### Performance Optimizations

- **Signal Memory Limit**: Maximum 20 signals stored per bug
- **Range Culling**: Only bugs within signal range process messages
- **Priority Sorting**: High-priority signals processed first
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents signal spam (15-tick minimum between signals)
- **Memory Cleanup**: Old signals automatically removed

## 📈 Evolution & Adaptation

### Selection Pressures

**Communication traits evolve under multiple pressures:**
- **Survival**: Better communication improves danger response
- **Reproduction**: Social bugs find mates more successfully  
- **Predation**: Pack hunting requires coordination abilities
